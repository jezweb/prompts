**Objective:** Based on the detailed project discovery information provided below, generate a comprehensive project plan document for "[Project Name - e.g., Central AI]".

**Instructions for AI:**
Use the information under "PROJECT DISCOVERY DETAILS" to structure a formal project plan. Organize the plan into the sections outlined below. Be thorough, clear, and professional. Where information might be inferred or is standard practice, feel free to include it, but clearly distinguish it if it's an assumption not explicitly stated in the discovery details.

**Desired Project Plan Sections:**

1.  **Executive Summary:**
    *   Brief overview of the project, its purpose, core objectives, and expected outcomes.
2.  **Project Goals & Objectives:**
    *   Clearly defined, measurable goals for the project (both MVP and longer-term if applicable).
3.  **Target Audience & Stakeholders:**
    *   Description of primary users, their needs, and key business stakeholders.
4.  **Scope Definition:**
    *   **In Scope (MVP):** Detailed list of features and functionalities for the MVP (use user stories if provided).
    *   **Future Scope (Post-MVP):** List of planned future enhancements.
    *   **Explicitly Out of Scope (MVP):** Features not being built in the MVP.
5.  **Technical Architecture & Stack:**
    *   Proposed/chosen technologies for frontend, backend, database, AI components (e.g., Flowise, Qdrant), integrations, and deployment environment.
    *   Rationale for choices if available.
6.  **Data Management & Models:**
    *   Overview of data types, storage, security considerations, and high-level data models/schemas (if details allow).
7.  **Key Features & Requirements (Detailed Breakdown):**
    *   (This section should expand on the MVP scope with more detailed requirements for each major feature area, similar to the plan we developed for Central AI, e.g., User Auth, Workspace Management, AI Interaction, Admin Config, etc.)
8.  **Non-Functional Requirements:**
    *   Performance, Usability, Reliability, Security, Maintainability, Scalability.
9.  **Deployment Strategy:**
    *   High-level plan for deploying the application.
10. **Assumptions:**
    *   Key assumptions made during planning.
11. **Potential Risks & Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Identification of potential risks (technical, resource, schedule, adoption) and preliminary ideas for how to mitigate them.
12. **Team Roles & Responsibilities (High-Level):**
    *   (If applicable, outline key roles needed, e.g., Project Lead, Developer, AI Specialist, QA).
13. **Success Metrics & KPIs:**
    *   How the success of the MVP and the ongoing project will be measured.
14. **High-Level Timeline/Roadmap (Optional - if information allows):**
    *   Key phases or milestones for the MVP.
