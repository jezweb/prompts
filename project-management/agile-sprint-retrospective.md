# The Sailboat Journey üõ•Ô∏è

Our team is a sailboat navigating toward our goals:
- **Wind**: What's helping us move forward?
- **Anchors**: What's slowing us down or holding us back?

- What does success look like for next sprint?
- What outcomes matter most to our stakeholders?

### ‚òÄÔ∏è Sun (What Energizes Us)
- What work excites the team?
- What achievements should we celebrate?
- What learning opportunities motivate us?
```

**3. Team Sharing and Clustering (25 minutes)**
- Share items for each category (5 minutes each)
- Group similar themes
- Identify patterns and connections

**4. Action Planning ({{#if (eq team_size "small")}}10{{else}}15{{/if}} minutes)**
- Focus on "Anchors" - what can we control and improve?
- Address "Rocks" - what risks can we mitigate?
- Leverage "Wind" - how can we do more of what works?

**5. Course Correction (5 minutes)**

- Commit to navigation changes (action items)
{{/if}}

{{#if (eq retrospective_format "mad-sad-glad")}}
### Mad, Sad, Glad Retrospective Format

Excellent for teams with {{team_dynamics}} dynamics.

#### Emotional Check-in Focus
```markdown
# Emotional Retrospective: Mad, Sad, Glad üò°üò¢üòä

This format helps us process emotions and turn feelings into actionable improvements.

## Guidelines for Emotional Safety
- Feelings are valid and important
- Focus on situations, not people
- Listen without judgment
- Turn emotions into constructive actions
```

#### Meeting Structure ({{#if (eq sprint_length "1")}}45{{else if (eq sprint_length "2")}}60{{else}}90{{/if}} minutes)

**1. Emotional Check-in (10 minutes)**
- Each person shares their overall sprint feeling
- No discussion, just listening and acknowledgment

**2. Individual Reflection (15 minutes)**
```markdown
## Reflection Categories

### üò° Mad (Frustration and Anger)
- What made you frustrated during the sprint?
- What blocked your progress unnecessarily?
- What felt unfair or poorly handled?
- What wasted your time or energy?

### üò¢ Sad (Disappointment and Regret)  
- What outcomes disappointed you?
- What opportunities did we miss?
- What didn't go as well as hoped?
- What would you have done differently?

### üòä Glad (Joy and Satisfaction)
- What made you happy during the sprint?
- What achievements are you proud of?
- What exceeded your expectations?
- What energized you or the team?
```

**3. Facilitated Sharing (30 minutes)**

{{#if (eq team_dynamics "high-conflict")}}
**Special Facilitation for High-Conflict Teams:**
- Share "Glad" items first to start positively
- Use "I" statements for "Mad" and "Sad" items
- Focus on specific situations, not personality traits
- Paraphrase back what you hear before responding
{{/if}}

- **Glad sharing (10 minutes)**: Celebrate successes and positive moments
- **Sad sharing (10 minutes)**: Acknowledge disappointments with empathy
- **Mad sharing (10 minutes)**: Address frustrations constructively

**4. Emotion-to-Action Translation ({{#if (eq team_size "small")}}10{{else}}15{{/if}} minutes)**
- For each "Mad" item: What change would prevent this frustration?
- For each "Sad" item: What would help us achieve better outcomes?
- For each "Glad" item: How can we create more of these positive experiences?

**5. Commitment to Emotional Health (5 minutes)**
- Agree on actions that improve team emotional well-being
- Plan check-ins for emotional safety

### Adaptations for New Agile Teams

#### Additional Structure and Guidance
```markdown
# New Team Retrospective Adaptations

## Pre-Retrospective Education
- [ ] Explain retrospective purpose and benefits
- [ ] Share examples of good retrospective inputs
- [ ] Set clear expectations for participation

- **Participation**: Ensure everyone contributes equally
- **Documentation**: Clear capture of all inputs and decisions

## Learning Focus
- Emphasize learning over blame
- Celebrate small improvements
- Build retrospective muscle gradually
- Focus on process basics before advanced techniques

## Follow-up Support
- Weekly check-ins on action item progress
- Additional coaching on agile practices
- Gradual increase in team self-management
