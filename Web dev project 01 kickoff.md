**Objective:** To thoroughly understand and document the foundational requirements, goals, and context for a new software project tentatively named "[Project Name - e.g., Central AI]". This information will be used to create a detailed project plan.

**Instructions for Response:** Please answer each question below as comprehensively as possible. Think from the perspective of the business, the end-users, and the technical team. Where applicable, provide specific examples.

**I. Project Vision & Purpose:**
    1.  **Problem/Opportunity:** What specific problem is this project trying to solve, or what opportunity is it trying to capitalize on?
    2.  **Core Purpose:** In one or two sentences, what is the absolute core purpose of this project?
    3.  **Motivation:** Why is this project important to undertake *now*? What are the drivers?
    4.  **Success Definition:** What does ultimate success look like for this project? How will we know if it has achieved its purpose? (Qualitative and quantitative if possible).

**II. Target Users & Stakeholders:**
    1.  **Primary Users:** Who are the primary end-users of this system? Describe their roles, technical proficiency, and typical tasks related to this project's domain.
    2.  **User Needs:** What are the key needs, pain points, or desires of these users that this project will address?
    3.  **Secondary Users (if any):** Are there other groups of users?
    4.  **Key Stakeholders:** Who are the key business stakeholders (e.g., decision-makers, budget holders, subject matter experts)? What are their primary interests in this project?

**III. Scope & Functionality:**
    1.  **Core MVP Functionality:** What are the absolute essential features that *must* be in the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) for it to deliver initial value and test core assumptions? (List as user stories if possible: "As a [user type], I want to [action] so that [benefit].")
    2.  **Key MVP Deliverables:** What are the tangible outputs or capabilities of the MVP?
    3.  **Future Ideas (Post-MVP):** What additional features, enhancements, or capabilities are envisioned for future iterations beyond the MVP?
    4.  **Explicitly Out of Scope (for MVP):** What features or functionalities will *not* be included in the MVP, even if they are desirable long-term?

**IV. Technical Considerations & Constraints:**
    1.  **Preferred Technologies/Stack:** Are there any preferred or mandated technologies, programming languages, frameworks, or platforms (e.g., React, Python, Supabase, Flowise, specific cloud providers)? Why?
    2.  **Existing Systems & Integrations:** Does this project need to integrate with any existing internal or external systems, APIs, or data sources? If so, please detail them.
    3.  **Data:** What types of data will the system handle (e.g., user data, documents, structured business data)? Are there any specific data security, privacy (e.g., GDPR, CCPA), or compliance requirements?
    4.  **Deployment Environment:** Where will this system be hosted (e.g., self-hosted, specific cloud, per-client servers)? Are there any constraints or preferences?
    5.  **Scalability Needs (Initial & Future):** What are the anticipated user loads, data volumes, and transaction rates for the MVP? What about for future growth?
    6.  **Security Requirements:** Are there any specific security standards, authentication mechanisms, or access control models that need to be implemented?

**V. Non-Functional Requirements:**
    1.  **Performance:** Are there specific performance expectations (e.g., page load times, API response times, AI query speed)?
    2.  **Usability:** How important is ease of use? Are there specific usability goals or accessibility standards (e.g., WCAG) to meet?
    3.  **Reliability/Availability:** What are the uptime requirements? What is the tolerance for downtime?
    4.  **Maintainability:** How will the system be maintained and updated post-launch?

**VI. Project Context & Practicalities:**
    1.  **Existing Solutions/Alternatives:** Are there any existing internal tools or third-party products that attempt to solve this problem? What are their strengths and weaknesses?
    2.  **Assumptions:** What key assumptions are we making about the users, technology, market, or problem domain?
    3.  **Potential Risks & Challenges:** What are the biggest known risks or potential challenges for this project (technical, business, resource-related)?
    4.  **Budget & Resources (if known):** Are there any known budget constraints or available resources (team members, skills)?
    5.  **Timeline Expectations (if any):** Are there any target deadlines or desired timeframes for the MVP or subsequent phases?

**VII. Success Metrics & KPIs (Key Performance Indicators):**
    1.  How will we measure the success of the MVP specifically?
    2.  What ongoing KPIs will indicate the project's health and value post-launch?

Please provide as much detail as possible. This will form the basis of our project plan.
