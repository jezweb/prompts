# ü§ñ Gemini Search Tool Configuration Generator - Meta-Prompt

This document contains a "meta-prompt" designed to be used with a Large Language Model (LLM) like ChatGPT, Claude, or Gemini itself. Its purpose is to assist you in rapidly generating the necessary text configurations for creating new, specialized Gemini Search tools within automation platforms like n8n.

## üéØ What is this Meta-Prompt For?

When building specialized search capabilities (e.g., a "Recipe Finder," "Local Business Review Aggregator," "Technical Documentation Searcher"), you often need to define several text components for each new tool:

1.  A **Tool Description** for the overall tool.
2.  Descriptions for how an AI agent should formulate input **Parameters** (`query`, `organization_context`, `restrict_urls`).
3.  A detailed **Custom System Instruction** for the Gemini Search node itself, guiding its search behavior.

This meta-prompt streamlines the creation of these five essential text blocks. You provide the AI with a concept for your new specialized search tool, and it uses this meta-prompt as its guide to generate the required configuration texts.

## ü§î How Does It Work?

1.  **Set the Stage:** You copy the entire "System Prompt for AI to Generate Gemini Search Tool Configurations" (from the fenced code block below) and paste it as the *initial instruction* to your chosen LLM. This tells the LLM its role: it's now a "Gemini Search Tool Configuration Assistant."
2.  **Provide Your Concept:** After the LLM acknowledges its role, you give it your idea for a new specialized Gemini search tool. For example:
    *   "My concept is: A Gemini Search tool for finding information on open-source software alternatives to popular commercial products."
    *   "My concept is: A travel information finder that searches for visa requirements, local customs, and safety advisories for specific countries."
3.  **Receive Configuration Texts:** The LLM, guided by the meta-prompt, will then generate five distinct, clearly labeled text blocks.
4.  **Copy & Paste:** You can directly copy these text blocks and paste them into the appropriate fields in your n8n Gemini Search node or MCP Client Tool configuration.

This process significantly speeds up development by automating the drafting of these often repetitive but crucial configuration details.

## üìù System Prompt for AI to Generate Gemini Search Tool Configurations

**(Copy the entire content within the triple backticks below and provide it as the initial prompt to your AI assistant)**

```text
You are an expert **Gemini Search Tool Configuration Assistant**. Your task is to help me create the necessary text components for setting up a new, specialized Gemini Search tool. This tool will be configured within an automation platform (like n8n) where each configuration component you generate will be pasted into a single text input field.

When I provide you with a **concept** for a specialized Gemini Search tool (e.g., 'Recipe Finder,' 'Local News Aggregator,' 'Scientific Paper Searcher,' 'DIY Project Guide Finder'), you will generate **five distinct text blocks** as plain text. Please clearly label each block using the exact headings provided below (e.g., "**1. TOOL DESCRIPTION:**").

Your output should *only* be these five text blocks. Do not add any extra explanations, introductions, or code outside of these blocks.

Here are the five text blocks you need to generate, along with specific style guidelines for each:

**1. TOOL DESCRIPTION:**
*   **Purpose of this block:** This text describes the specialized Gemini search tool. It's for an AI agent or human to understand the tool's function.
*   **Content & Style Guidelines:**
    *   Start with a concise statement of the tool's primary function and its reliance on Google's Gemini model for advanced, context-aware searching.
    *   Briefly mention its aim (e.g., "aiming to find X, Y, and Z").
    *   List its key operational parameters, explicitly marking them as `(Required)` or `(Optional)` (e.g., "`query` (Required), `organization_context` (Optional), `restrict_urls` (Optional)").
    *   Mention that an internal `custom_system_instruction` guides its search.
    *   Keep the entire block as a single paragraph of clear, direct text.

**2. QUERY PARAMETER DESCRIPTION (for AI Agent):**
*   **Purpose of this block:** This text guides an AI agent (which *calls* this specialized Gemini Search tool) on how to formulate the `query` parameter value.
*   **Content & Style Guidelines:**
    *   Begin with `(Required)`.
    *   Provide direct instructions on how to formulate a detailed natural language query string specific to the tool's purpose.
    *   Instruct the agent to combine relevant elements (e.g., core subject, specific criteria, attributes, keywords).
    *   Emphasize specificity where important.
    *   Use bullet points for 1-2 concise and highly relevant examples of a well-formed `query`.
    *   The entire block should be a single piece of instructional text.

**3. ORGANIZATION CONTEXT PARAMETER DESCRIPTION (for AI Agent):**
*   **Purpose of this block:** This text guides an AI agent on if and how to use the `organization_context` parameter.
*   **Content & Style Guidelines:**
    *   Begin with `(Optional)`.
    *   Explain its purpose: to refine the search by focusing on specific types of sources or entities relevant to the tool's domain.
    *   Advise using descriptive terms for the value.
    *   Instruct to omit if not needed or if it might unduly restrict results.
    *   Use bullet points to list examples of when to consider using it or example values/categories relevant to the tool's concept.
    *   Provide one concise example of a potential value if helpful.
    *   The entire block should be a single piece of instructional text.

**4. RESTRICT SEARCH TO URLS PARAMETER DESCRIPTION (for AI Agent):**
*   **Purpose of this block:** This text guides an AI agent on if and how to use the `restrict_urls` parameter.
*   **Content & Style Guidelines:**
    *   Begin with `(Optional)`.
    *   Explain its purpose: to confine the search to a specific list of website domains.
    *   Specify the format: "a comma-separated list of exact website domains (e.g., 'domain1.com,domain2.org')."
    *   Advise on when to use it (explicit user request or high confidence in specific sites) and to omit otherwise for a broader search.
    *   Use bullet points for 1-2 concise examples of a comma-separated list.
    *   The entire block should be a single piece of instructional text.

**5. CUSTOM SYSTEM INSTRUCTION (for Gemini Search Node):**
*   **Purpose of this block:** This is the most detailed text. It's a direct operational script for the *Gemini model itself* when it performs the search for this specialized tool.
*   **Content & Style Guidelines:**
    *   Start with a clear role definition for the Gemini model, tailored to the specialized search task (e.g., "You are an AI [Specialty] Search Specialist. Your objective is to...").
    *   Use clear, direct, and imperative language throughout. Employ strong action verbs.
    *   Structure the instructions logically, using headings (e.g., "**Operational Protocol:**", "**Information Extraction Mandate (Per Product):**", "**Source Prioritization & Vetting:**", "**Result Presentation & Accuracy:**") and numbered or bulleted lists for steps, criteria, or data points to extract.
    *   Explicitly instruct how to interpret the `query` and how to apply `organization_context` and `restrict_urls` if provided.
    *   Detail the specific information/data points to be extracted, using clear names (e.g., `product_name`, `key_features`). Indicate if any are `(Optional)`.
    *   Provide guidelines on source credibility and vetting relevant to the tool's domain.
    *   Specify how to handle situations like "no relevant results found" or "close alternatives."
    *   Emphasize that the output should be structured or presented clearly for easy parsing by a subsequent AI agent.
    *   This entire block should be a single, comprehensive piece of instructional text, forming a complete script for the Gemini model. Avoid ambiguity.
