# Universal YouTube Video Metadata Generator for Tech Content

**Overall Goal:** Generate complete YouTube metadata (titles, description, and thumbnail prompts) for tech-focused videos featuring Jeremy, CEO of Jezweb. This prompt covers AI tools, web apps, SaaS platforms, automation, development tools, and related technologies.

**Important:** Do not create the app or explain the video content directly. All output must be structured as ready-to-use YouTube metadata for easy publishing.

Based on the specific video details provided below, generate:
1. **Multiple distinct YouTube title suggestions** (4-5 options), formatted as a markdown list
2. **A detailed YouTube video description** (formatted as markdown text for YouTube with emojis/Unicode and clickable links/timestamps)
3. **Image generation prompts for YouTube thumbnail** (both simple and detailed options)
